            <h1>Why Should You Run More Fun Cards in your Decks</h1>
            <p>Magic is a game, a game where you are building a deck to win. In almost every format, this means running what you believe to be the strongest cards in the card pool avaliable to you. However, Commander is a bit different. Commander is a social format, a game where the expectations of deck building are not as black and white. Rather, it is almost a dance, where everyone is trying to get on the same page in terms of the power of your decks, in order to have the most fair, and fun experience for everyone. A strong deck can steamroll a pod, and a weak deck can leave a player in the dust, both of which results in at least someone not having fun.</p>
            <p>There are also other struggles you may find when you are trying to have the most fun in your commander games. Even if the strength of each deck may be somewhat equal in power, there are still the struggles of understanding what kind of cards, and even decks, are considered fun. If you play a control heavy deck, where no one gets to play the game, because all you play are board wipes, then no one is going to have fun. While, even if you avoid running toxic cards, and find a good balance of power, there is always a few things you can do to help make your decks more fun. If you have a play group, I would encourage at least one player to have a group hug deck, a deck designed to help everyone at the table, by drawing everyone cards, doubling mana, and more. Another deck someone can build is a chaos deck, where the rules of magic get flipped on their head. Running cards like knowledge pool, can create a unique game, where you can find fun interactions as everyone starts playing from a pool of each other player's cards. One more thing that I encourage people to do, is to build a treasure cruise, an alternate deck that everyone can play with, with various curses, and benefits, depending on what you roll. Playing this way will affect the competitiveness, and the seriousness of your games, so, before you play any one of them, ask your table if they would be interested in playing this way. While it may not be for everyone, it can bring a new levels of spice to your commander experience</p>
